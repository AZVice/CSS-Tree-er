# CSS Bootstrap

## Code Libraries and Frameworks

Oftentimes, developers find that they have the same problems in many projects.

When it comes to CSS, a number of problems happen over and over again. For example:
- Consistency across browsers
- Making a responsive/mobile and desktop version
- Styling forms to look more modern and user friendly

Rather than each developer coding their own solution and using it over and over again, developers get together and make a code library or framework.

One popular CSS framework is called Bootstrap. It was initially developed at twitter and was made open source in 2011. As an open source project, anyone can use these code solutions for free and they can also contribute to improving the project.

## Shifting Strategies

While a base understanding of CSS is critical in building websites, in order to get the most out of a code library/framework is the ability to read the documentation and learn to use the built-in features.

[Bootstrap's documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) is quite good. As you look through it, you will see that it has many features. The more you build with it, the more you'll learn. Today we'll focus on getting set up and looking at some basic features.

## Get coding

Today we'll be building Tree-er. The html is complete all we have to do is add the bootstrap code library and apply the appropriate classes.
